# Whaddya
Check out the deployed app! [Whaddya](https://whaddya.herokuapp.com/#)

This project is a full stack web app designed to address the common question presented when people hang out: "What do you want to do?". 
It is currently designed to assist with movie selection. The user can sign in, select a preferred platform and select a preferred genre.
The data is sent to the Utelly API and the TMDB API to gather information about the movies returned from our movie database. This info is presented back to the user, and they can swipe left or right on the movies!
